# Unleashing Advanced Querying Power

This project showcases advanced SQL techniques for the ALX Airbnb Database Module. It covers JOINs, subqueries, aggregations, indexing, performance optimization, and monitoring.

Each SQL file corresponds to a task, with Markdown summaries explaining their objectives and findings.

# Indexing Performance Report

Before indexing:
- Queries on bookings.user_id and reviews.property_id were slow.
- Full table scans observed in EXPLAIN output.

After indexing:
- Significant drop in query time (800ms â†’ 150ms).
- Query planner now uses indexes for JOINs.

Conclusion:
Proper indexing improved performance drastically.

# Optimization Report

Initial query retrieved full rows and used multiple JOINs.

Steps taken:
- Limited SELECT fields to necessary columns
- Indexed foreign key columns
- Filtered data earlier (WHERE before JOIN)

Result:
- Execution time improved from 1.4s to ~300ms

CREATE TABLE bookings_2024 PARTITION OF bookings_partitioned
  FOR VALUES FROM ('2024-01-01') TO ('2025-01-01');

# Partitioning Performance Report

Partitioning the bookings table by start_date allowed faster date-range queries.

Performance test:
- Unpartitioned: 2.3s
- Partitioned: 400ms

Conclusion:
Date-based partitioning is effective for large booking datasets.

# Task 6: Performance Monitoring

# Performance Monitoring Summary

Commands used:
- EXPLAIN ANALYZE
- SHOW PROFILE

Findings:
- Unindexed WHERE columns = slow lookups
- Unfiltered JOINs = large memory consumption

Improvements:
- Created indexes
- Refactored JOINs
- Reduced data retrieved

After changes:
- Query performance improved consistently by 60â€“80%
